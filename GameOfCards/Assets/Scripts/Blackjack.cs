    /* Blackjack Rules:
     * The player attemps to beat the dealer by getting a count as 
     * close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
     * 
     * Card Values / Scoring:
     * It is up to each individial player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. 
     * Face cards are 10 and any other card is its face value.
     * 
     * The Deal:
     * The dealer gives one card face up to each player, and then one card face up to himself.
     * Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each plauer, 
     * but the dealer takes his second card face down.
     * 
     * The Play:
     * The player must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or 
     * "hit" (ask for nother cad in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, 
     * or even hit 21 exactly. Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, 
     * or he may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until he either decides to stand
     * on the total (if it is 21 or under) or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case,
     * the player loses.
     * 
     * The Dealer's Play:
     * When the dealer has served every okayer, his face down card is turned up. 
     * If the total is 17 or more, he must stand. If the total is 16 or under,
     * he must take a card. He must continue to take cards until the total is 17
     * or more, at which point the dealer must stand.
